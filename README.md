There is always a huge demand for used cars. As sales of new cars have slowed down in the recent past, the pre-owned car market has continued to grow over the past years and is larger than the new car market now. Cars4U is a growing tech start-up in North America that aims to find a good strategy in this market.
In 2018-19, while new car sales were recorded at 3.6 million units, around 4 million second-hand cars were bought and sold. There is a slowdown in new car sales and that could mean that the demand is shifting towards the pre-owned market. In fact, some car sellers replace their old cars with pre-owned cars instead of buying new ones. Keeping this in mind, the pricing scheme of these used cars becomes important in order to grow in the market.
As a senior data scientist at Cars4U, you have to come up with a pricing model that can effectively predict the price of used cars and can help the business in devising profitable strategies using differential pricing. For example, if the business knows the market price, it will never sell anything below it.
The objectives are the following:
Explore basic stats and visualize the dataset.
Generate a set of insights and recommendations that will help the business.
This will help determine the factors that would affect the price of used cars.
